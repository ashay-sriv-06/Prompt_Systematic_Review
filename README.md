Papers we should not include due to being poorly written or AI generated



## Notes

- Sometimes a paper title may appear differently on the arXiv API. For example, "Visual Attention-Prompted Prediction and Learning" (arXiv:2310.08420), according to arXiv API is titled "A visual encoding model based on deep neural networks and transfer learning"

- When testing APIs, there may be latency and aborted connections
